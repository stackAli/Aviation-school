    <p class="article-intro">
        Learning to fly is one of the most exciting decisions you can make. Whether you want to fly for fun or begin a journey toward a commercial aviation career, it’s important to understand how pilot training costs work in Melbourne.
    </p>

    <p class="article-intro">

        <strong>Moorabbin Airport (YMMB)</strong> — Melbourne’s busiest general aviation hub.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">What Determines Pilot Training Costs?</h2>

    <p>
        Pilot training costs can vary based on several factors including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Aircraft type and fuel costs</li>
        <li>Instructor time (dual vs solo hours)</li>
        <li>Required flight hours for RPL or PPL</li>
        <li>Ground school and exam preparation</li>
        <li>CASA testing and medical fees</li>
        <li>Your training pace and flying frequency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Every student progresses differently, and our instructors ensure your time in the air is productive and efficient.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Recreational Pilot Licence (RPL) Costs in Melbourne</h2>

    <p>
        Your RPL is your first aviation milestone — the licence that allows you to fly as pilot-in-command. Costs vary depending on the time you take to build confidence and meet competency standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Training includes dual flights, solo flights, ground school, radio operations, and airspace procedures. The overall cost depends on how frequently you fly and how quickly you progress.

    <hr>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Private Pilot Licence (PPL) Costs</h2>

    <p>
        A PPL expands your flying privileges across Australia and includes advanced navigation, longer solo flights, emergency training, and CASA theory exams.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because PPL training involves more hours and longer flights, total costs are higher — but the progression from RPL to PPL is smooth and structured.
